## Build frontend scripts and styles

Run the command `npm run build` to build the .js and .css frontend files.

When developing scripts and styles it is useful to use the `npm run build:watch` command so that the .js and .css frontend files are automatically rebuilt.

> The built frontend files are output to the `Dfe.SchoolAccount.Web/wwwroot/` directory and are not committed to the repository.
